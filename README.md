TEACHEASY
This project introduces an innovative approach to attendance tracking by integrating a GPS-based system. Students can mark their attendance only when they are within 50 meters of the teacher's location, eliminating the possibility of proxies and manual errors.

Beyond attendance management, this system enhances the academic experience with additional features. It includes a smart recommendation system for students' marks, helping them track their progress effectively. Teachers also benefit from a dedicated syllabus diary, ensuring organized lesson planning. Additionally, the platform allows seamless uploading and analysis of students' marks across various subjects, providing valuable insights for both educators and learners.Teacheasy
